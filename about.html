          Cognitive computing is the use of computerized models to simulate the
          human thought process in complex situations where the answers may be
          ambiguous and uncertain. Not to be confused with Artificial
          Intelligence, the theory and development of computer systems able to
          perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, Cognitive
          Computing with the programming langauge Julia is well suited for
          numerical analysis and computational sciences. Although Julia is a
          general purpose programming language (any application can be built in
          it.) Julia is a high level, high performance, dynamic programming
          language that is by far the best exhibition of my tech life skills.

          applications can be served in real time through modules or components
          being loaded onto the DOM (Document Object Model) asynchronously. The
          React Library allows for fast communication between other
          technologies. React Hooks used with Express, MongoDB, and Node.js has
          withstood the test of time in an industry where we phase in and out of
          technologies frequently.

        <h2 class="section-title">SEO</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Google's mission statement and primary purpose is to organize the
          world's data. It is what most people use when inquiring about
          anything. Having an in depth understanding of the search optimizations
          algorithm is complex, anti-pattern, and takes a lot of self study and
          investigation to target just how we can climb the ranks of SEO. Using
          Keyword software we have a better understanding of the queries that
          can be manifested from words relating to our business, product, and
          service. Using keyword software we can blacklist our competitors and
          create a CSV file full of queries and keywords. Using Unique Images
          that exist nowhere else in our web pages promotes better SEO.
          Utilizing image alt tags and double quotes in said alt tags tells the
          search function "I AM IMPORTANT." Using related keywords within the
          first and last 100 words of our webpages has shown my clients
          successful results. Using related keywords in h1, h2, h3 tags has also
          proven successful. The readablity of a webpage can also be a factor in
          SEO. Their is no better promotion for SEO than having a wonderful
          business, product, and service. There is no blueprint for this but
          working on your website and application's functionality is a great
          place to start.

          Throughout my life, I have wanted to cause a societal shift in the way
          we as human beings do things. I want to create an application that has
          a drastic effect on society, both economically and ethically. I began
          to map out the best way I could achieve this and the best method of
          approach is to give freely of everything I have ever learned about
          Technology. By doing so I reach more people and there is a better
          chance someone can make a positive change in the world. Their have
          been a few teachers that have impacted the way that I think about
          education in the past. I hope to one day hire software engineers to
          teach alongside me at my non-profit organization. Until then, it is
          just myself and my youtube channel, where I promote higher education
          in computing for no cost.
